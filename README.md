### Note

The original code has this enlightening comment:

```bash
# -L make any option changes local to the function
# -R all setable options are set to their default values.
# thus using this makes sure the function will work the same way
# regardless of their settings. Not really necessary here... but
# good practice.
emulate -RL zsh
```
